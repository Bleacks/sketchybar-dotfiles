# Summary 

This project is based on [Sketchybar](https://github.com/FelixKratz/SketchyBar) and [FelixKratz](https://github.com/FelixKratz/dotfiles/tree/master/.config/sketchybar)'s config, and aims to be a replacement from my [previous config](https://github.com/Bleacks/simple-bar), relying on [Jean-Tinland's Simple-bar](https://github.com/Jean-Tinland/simple-bar) and [Ãœbersicht](https://github.com/felixhageloh/uebersicht).

Current efforts are mostly related to yabai, but more will come

Once a first version is ready, an installation and configuration guide will be posted here for specifcs
